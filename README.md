### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Yan from Canada and I study in Computer Science/Software engineering. I really enjoy learning new languages and frameworks and test my skills on personal web-based projects. 

While I'm not on my keyboard, I'm probably lifthing heavy stuff or gathering with friends around cold beverages.ğŸ¥ƒ
